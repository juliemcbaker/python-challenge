PyBank takes basic financial information from a two-column csv file (budget_data.csv) that gives dates and profit/loss for each time period.
Once data is extracted the program: (1) finds the number of months, (2) calculates the net total from profit/loss, 
(3) identifies the most profitable month (and it's profit value), (4) identifies the least profitable month (and it's loss value),
and (5) calculates the the average month-to-month change in profit/loss.
The program then outputs this information both through the terminal and as budget_result.txt file.

PyPoll takes basic poll data from a three-column csv file (election_data.csv) that gives voter ID, county, and candidate chosen.
To expedite testing, a smaller data file (election_test.csv) was used during development.
Once data is extracted to program: (1) counts total votes, (2) creates a list of candidates, (3) counts votes per candidate, 
(4) determines the winner, (5) determines 2nd, 3rd, and 4th places, and (6) calculates percentage of votes each candidate received.
The program then outputs a report of the results both through terminal and as election_results.txt file.
